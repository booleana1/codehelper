// This file is deprecated and replaced by developer-mentor-flow.ts
// Intentionally left blank or with a deprecation notice if strict file deletion isn't desired.
// For this exercise, we assume it's effectively replaced by renaming.
// If Studio doesn't support file renaming directly via XML, this file would be deleted
// and developer-mentor-flow.ts would be a new file.
// Given the XML structure, I will treat this as a "delete" by providing empty content,
// as the new flow is in `developer-mentor-flow.ts`.
